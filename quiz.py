"""
  Runs the main loop of the linear equation quiz

  Game consists of multiple rounds where the user solves equations
  User starts with 3 lives and loses one for each incorrect answer
  Game ends when the user runs out of lives or decides to quit after a round

  Tracks:
    - Total score
    - Accuracy
    - Rounds
    - Questions answered

  Displays:
    - Feedback on each answer (correct or wrong)
    - Health bar representing remaining lives

  Returns:
    None
